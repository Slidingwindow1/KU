Alexa is given n piles of equal or
 unequal heights. In one step, Alexa 
can remove any number of boxes from the
 pile which has the maximum height and 
try to make it equal to the one which is 
just lower than the maximum height of the
 stack. Determine the minimum number of 
steps required to make all of the piles
 equal in height.


public int minSteps(int[] piles){
        int len = piles.length;
        if(len <= 1) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        int res = 0, distinctNums = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < len; ++i){
            if(piles[i] == piles[i - 1]){
                res += distinctNums;
            }
            else{
                ++distinctNums;
                res += distinctNums;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
