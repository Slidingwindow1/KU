You want to schedule a certain number of trips with a collection of several cabs.

Given an integer n representing a desired number of trips, and an array cabTravelTime representing your cabs and how long it takes each cab (at that index of the array) to make a trip, return the minimum time required to make n trips.

Assume that cabs can run simultaneously and there is no waiting period between trips. There may be multiple cabs with the same time cost.*

Examples
If n=3 and cabTravelTime=[1,2], then the answer is 2. This is because the first cab (index 0, cost 1) can make 2 trips costing a total of 2 time units, and the second cab can make a single trip costing 2 at the same time.

n=10
cabTravelTime=[1,3,5,7,8]

* 7 trips with cab 0 (cost 1)
* 2 trips with cab 1 (cost 3)
* 1 trip with cab 2 (cost 5)
So, answer is 7 (there could be other combinations)

n=3
cabTravelTime=[3,4,8]

* 2 trips with cab 0 (cost 6)
* 1 trip with cab 1 (cost 4)
Time = 6
